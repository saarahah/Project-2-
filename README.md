# Project 2 Unheard Stories

## Description
As developers we created an app where the user creates a profile and adds a story about drug abuse. After the user submits the story the user is taking to a USA map, in this web page the user will be able to see circles on the map which represent how many people have died of drug abuse in the States. Also the user will be able to click on the blue markers on the map to see stories from others users and see that this is on going problem so they can help themselves or someone they know so they can stop using drugs.
